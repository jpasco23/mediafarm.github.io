      Interactive Telecommunications Program and, with an interest in user-centered design, sought to
      apply its principles to emerging technology to create systems that improve operations and create new

      many different levels to see the big picture. Every employee at Media Farm is smart, hard-working
      and experienced, and able to listen and adapt to change. This is a key benefit because every project is
      a custom solution, serving a very specific set of needs for each client. That blend of experience and
      agility is what makes projects succeed.</p></td>
